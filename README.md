# django-Htmx
Working with the most beautiful library for sending Ajax requests in ssr.

## Description

Django UX is wack and I can't contain my joy the day i found out about HTMX, it's an ajax library that really take Server Side Rendered pages UX from 0 to 99, it interect with backend through ajax call in html and with html, we dont have to loose the rich features of Django and turn it to a dumb JSON producer.
